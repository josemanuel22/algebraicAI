We implemented in python 3 the problem of finding the heaviest string of literals from a symmetric `NXN` dimension array. 
We approach this problem as if it were a graph. We apply the [Breadth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) algorithm. There are obvious improvements such as calculating the weight of the paths in the same Breadth-first search
